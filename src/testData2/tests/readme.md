# Overview

The Xeto test suite is provided as a directory of YAML files.
Each file tests one major feature of the infrastructure.  A test
file contains one or more test cases as YAML documents.

# Test Case

Each test case is a YAML document.  A test case must specify a `name`
field which uniquely defines the test within its YAML file.  Names
are used to run and report test cases.

The remainder of the test case fields define a step within the test.
The field name identifies the step type, and the value is the argument
to the step.  Steps come in two flavors: setup and verifies.  Setup
performs some action such as compiling Xeto source code into a library.
Verifies are used to verify the setup steps.

The following are the step types discussed in further detail below:
  - **loadLib**: load a predefined library by name
  - **compileLib**: compile a library from source code
  - **compileData**: compile data from from source code
  - **verifyType**: verify a type from the active library
  - **verifyTypes**: convenience to verify a list of types
  - **verifyData**: verify the data value from compileData

# Test Steps

## loadLib

Load a library by name.  This library becomes the active library for
use with steps such as `verifyType`.

Examples:

    loadLib: "sys"

## compileLib

Compile a library from source.  This library becomes the active library for
use with steps such as `verifyType`.
Examples:

    compileLib: |
      Foo: Dict { someMarker }
      Bar: Foo

## compileData

Compile a data value from source.  This value becomes the active data for
use with steps such as `verifyData`.

    compileData: |
      Date "2023-03-05"

## verifyType

Verify a type by name from the active library (see `loadLib` and `compileLib`).
The value is a map with the following fields:

  - **name**: simple name of the type within the library
  - **supertype**: qname of the supertype
  - **meta**: map of the effective meta formatted as `verifyData`
  - **slots** map of the effective slots

The slot map is the expected slot spec which follows the same rules
as `verifyType` with the exception that `supertype` is replaced with `type`.

## verifyTypes

This is a convenience for verifying a list of types in the active library
using a map of type names.  It follows the exact same conditions as `verifyType`
with the exception that `name` is omitted.

## verifyData

Verify a data value.

Scalars are verified using the syntax "type value".  If the type is marker
then the value is omitted:

    "sys::Str hello world"
    "sys::Marker"
    "sys::Number 123"

Dicts are verified as a map where the keys specify the expected value type.
Plus each Dict value should have a 'spec' field with the qname of the dict's
type:

    spec: "sys::Dict"
    str: "sys::Str hello world"
    marker: "sys::Marker"

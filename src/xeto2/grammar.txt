Values
******
Scalar values may take one of the following formats:
  - single double-quoted string such as "hi"
  - triple double-quoted strings such as """my name is "Brian", hi!"""
  - numbers with embedded units/symbols such as 123% or 2023-03-04

Quoted strings use the same backslash escape sequence as C languages:
  - '\n'  for newline
  - '\\'  for backslash itself
  - '\"' for double-quote itself (triple quoted string does not require escaping)
  - '\u2023" unicode hex value

Number literals must start with an ASCII digit or "-" followed by an ASCII digit.
Any of the following characters are matched to tokenize the number literal:
  - ASCII digit or letter 0-9, A-Z, a-z
  - "." dot (0x2E)
  - "-" dash (0x2D)
  - ":" colon (0x3A)
  - "/" forward slash (0x2F)
  - "$" dollar sign (0x24)
  - "%" percent sign (0x25)
  - any Unicode character > 0x7F
